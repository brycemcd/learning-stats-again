# README

At one time, when I was in school, I learned statistics pretty well. I've since worked in business intelligence 
and data engineering professionally but my 1st principle statistics knowledge is out of practice. This repo will
chronicle my journey back through elementary and mid level statistics in the hopes that it will help others.
